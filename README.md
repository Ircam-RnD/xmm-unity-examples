# xmm-unity-examples

Repository containing various examples of how to use the
[xmm-unity plugin](https://github.com/Ircam-RnD/xmm-unity).

#### getting started

You should first clone the xmm-unity repository.
All the example projects require that you compile the plugin for the desired
platform, then drop it into the `Assets/Plugins` subfolder, and that you copy
the `XmmEngine.cs` wrapper file into the `Assets/Scripts` subfolder.  
Instructions on how to compile can be found in the README of the plugin's
repository.
